            <h3>The time for rigor will come soon enough</h3>

            <p>You might have heard: The bigger the scope of your problem, the more rigorous your approach must be. It applies to projects and organizations alike.</p>
            <p>It’s a correlation often associated with the notion of “getting away with something”. Like, you can get away with not having large, frequent status meetings because you’re still small, but when you grow, you’ll have to do it. So might as well start now!</p>

            <div>

            </div>

            <p>But what if you don’t grow? What if you don’t want to grow? Adopting all the rigors of a supertanker when you’re sailing a rowboat doesn’t make for a better journey. It doesn’t mean supertanker rigor isn’t worthwhile for the supertanker, it just means it isn’t for you. Premature rigor can kill the spark long before it has time to start a fire.</p>
            <p>This applies to all aspects of the endeavor: Policies, processes, metrics, and certainties. It’s so much easier to wing it, when all it takes to lift you up is a single gust of wind. But not only is it easier, it’s the right thing to do! You’re not cheating; there’s nothing to feel guilty about.</p>
            <p>It’s kind of like growing up. I remember at times doubting whether finishing high school was worth it. I already knew computers, I already knew how to make money. Surely I could just get a job and really start living life…</p>

            <h3>Floats in CSS: the very basics</h3>

            <p>Imagine all the elements of a page are attracted to a mighty force that comes from the top left corner of the page. Every time you add an element, it is kind of vacuumed by the top left and will stay stuck up here. Then all the elements after it will stack one after another.</p>
            <p>There are two types of elements, that will not behave the same. The "block" elements will stack and take the whole width of the page. So if you add block elements one after another, they will stack up one below the other.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/impressivewebs/2011-11/block.jpg">
            </div>


            <p>But there is another kind of element, which is the "inline" element. This type of element will not take up the whole width of the page, it will align next to other inline elements. </p>

            <div>
                <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/25220ed47e1494ffc8e796a8e1413ee33213699c/687474703a2f2f6e6574646e612e77656264657369676e65726465706f742e636f6d2f75706c6f6164732f323031322f30382f626f786d6f64656c2d626c6f636b2d76732d696e6c696e652e706e67">
            </div>

            <p>If we want to tell a block element to take less space so we can squeeze another element next to it, we will have to give it a width : to tell him for example that he will only be able to take half of the page.</p>
            <p>But other elements still cannot go next to him, unless we tell all of them that it's okay for all of them to "float". They can now go let themselves be vacuumed from the top left corner and fill the other half the element left.<br/>
                When you apply "float", left or right, other elements can squeeze themselves on the space left by the previous element.</p>

            <h3>Finding Time to Become a Better Developer</h3>

            <p>There’s no time for anything. At least that’s how it feels doesn’t it? No time to learn all the things you think you need to learn to stay ahead of the curve. No time to go back and refactor that ugly piece of code. It works (sort of) and there’s a deadline approaching. No time to write unit tests for everything. No time to write documentation or comments for the next guy who gets stuck maintaining what you wrote. No time to think. No time to breathe. No time!</p>
            <p>Well… if you take the time to read this article, I promise you’ll find yourself with more time for what’s important.</p>
            <p>I used to think that the only way to be a great developer was to work myself sick. My health, friendships, and family all suffered because of it. Understanding the following 5 truths about time management for a developer is what saved me.</p>

            <div>

            </div>

            <p>There is no question that a good developer should always be learning, but where you focus your learning can make a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to stay on top of your game.</p>
